          <h1><u>The Climate Change</u></h1>
          <p>
            Climate change refers to significant, long-term changes in the Earth's climate, particularly an increase
            in
            temperature.This phenomenon is largely driven by human activities, such as burning fossil fuels,
            deforestation, and industrialprocesses, which release large amounts of greenhouse gases like carbon
            dioxide
            (CO2) and methane (CH4) into theatmosphere. These gases trap heat, leading to a warming effect known as
            the
            greenhouse effect.Climate change refers to significant, long-term changes in the Earth's climate,
